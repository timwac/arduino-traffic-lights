# arduino-traffic-lights


Code for a Traffic light junction with a button to allow pedestrian crossing.


# Future enhancements:
Refactor TrafficLight class to be aware of its current state and what its next state should be. This would prevent the traffic lights getting into an invalid state.
Each light is on its own PIN. AN EEPROM could be programmed with each state.
